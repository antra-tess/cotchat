# COTChat

A streamlined CLI chat interface designed for DeepSeek models, with support for reasoning traces and streaming responses.

## Quick Start

Clone into a local directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antra-tess/cotchat
```

Install as editable package:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Start:
```bash
cotchat
```

OpenRouter now supports reasoning traces. You can still use DeepSeek if you prefer.
